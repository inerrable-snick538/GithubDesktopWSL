# GitHub Desktop WSL

A fork of [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) that makes WSL repositories work properly. If you develop in WSL but want a GUI for git, this is for you.

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/aleixrodriala/github-desktop-wsl/releases/latest)**

> Installs side-by-side with official GitHub Desktop — you can keep both.

## The problem

Official GitHub Desktop can't handle repos inside WSL. When you open a `\\wsl.localhost\...` path:

- **Git commands are unusably slow** — Desktop runs Windows `git.exe`, which accesses WSL files through the [9P protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems). Every file stat, read, and open is a round-trip across the VM boundary.
- **SSH keys don't work** — Desktop injects a Windows-only `SSH_ASKPASS` binary that breaks SSH inside WSL.
- **File operations fail** — Checking merge/rebase state, reading diffs, writing `.gitignore` — all go through 9P and are either slow or broken.
- **Deleting repos fails** — Windows Recycle Bin doesn't support WSL UNC paths.

## The solution

This fork runs a lightweight **daemon inside WSL** that executes git and file operations natively. Desktop talks to it over TCP instead of going through 9P.

```
Official Desktop (slow path):
  Desktop → git.exe → Windows kernel → 9P → VM boundary → WSL → ext4
  (every file operation is a round-trip)

This fork (fast path):
  Desktop → TCP → daemon → git (native) → ext4
  (one round-trip per command, git has direct disk access)
```

The daemon is bundled inside the installer. When you open a WSL repo, it's deployed and started automatically. There's nothing to configure.

## Performance

**6x-27x faster** across all git operations compared to official Desktop on WSL repos.

### Real Desktop workflows

These are the actual sequences Desktop runs during common operations:

| Workflow | This fork | Official Desktop | Speedup |
|----------|----------:|-----------------:|--------:|
| Open / switch to a repo | 16 ms | 173 ms | **11x** |
| Populate branch list + dates | 6 ms | 88 ms | **14x** |
| View last commit diff | 4 ms | 44 ms | **10x** |
| Pre-fetch checks | 3 ms | 82 ms | **26x** |

> Benchmarks: 7 iterations, median, WSL2 on Windows 11. The "open repo" workflow includes `git status`, `for-each-ref`, 4 `pathExists` checks, `readFile`, and `git log`.

### Why the difference is so large

`git.exe` running on a WSL repo has a ~40ms floor for *any* operation — that's the cost of launching `git.exe` through 9P and resolving paths across the VM boundary. Our daemon has ~2ms overhead (TCP round-trip + message framing). The actual git work is the same; the difference is entirely in how files are accessed.

## Install

1. Download **[GitHubDesktopWSLSetup-x64.exe](https://github.com/aleixrodriala/github-desktop-wsl/releases/latest)**
2. Run the installer
3. Open any WSL repository

That's it. The app:
- Detects WSL paths automatically (`\\wsl.localhost\...` or `\\wsl$\...`)
- Deploys the daemon to `~/.local/bin/` in your WSL distro on first use
- Starts the daemon via `--daemonize` (forks to background)
- Reconnects automatically if the daemon crashes
- Falls through to normal Desktop behavior for Windows repos

> SmartScreen may warn on first install (the fork is unsigned). Click "More info" then "Run anyway".

## How it works

### Components

**`wsl-git-daemon`** (C, ~550 lines, zero dependencies)
A persistent daemon that runs inside WSL. Listens on TCP `127.0.0.1` on a random port. Handles:
- Git commands — forks git with proper pipes for stdout/stderr/stdin
- File operations — read, write, stat, pathExists, unlink via direct syscalls
- Security — token-based auth, localhost-only connections

**`wsl.ts`** (TypeScript, ~420 lines)
The Desktop-side client. Responsibilities:
- **Path detection** — identifies `\\wsl.localhost\...` and `\\wsl$\...` paths, extracts distro name
- **Lifecycle management** — deploy binary, start/restart daemon, health check
- **Protocol client** — binary length-prefixed frames over TCP
- **Drop-in wrappers** — `wslReadFile()`, `wslPathExists()`, etc. that route to daemon for WSL paths and fall through to native `fs` for Windows paths

**`core.ts` patch** (1 check)
All git commands in Desktop flow through `git()` in `core.ts`. A single `if (isWSLPath(path))` routes WSL repos through the daemon while leaving Windows repos completely untouched.

### Wire protocol

```
Frame: [type: 1 byte][length: 4 bytes big-endian][payload: N bytes]

Client → Daemon:
  INIT  (0x01)  JSON { token, cmd, args, cwd, stdin, path }
  STDIN (0x02)  Raw bytes (for writeFile content, empty = EOF)

Daemon → Client:
  STDOUT      (0x03)  Raw bytes (git output / file content)
  STDERR      (0x04)  Raw bytes
  EXIT        (0x05)  4-byte exit code
  ERROR       (0x06)  UTF-8 error message
  STAT_RESULT (0x07)  JSON { exists, size, isDir }
```

### Daemon lifecycle

```
User opens WSL repo
  → Desktop detects \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\...
  → Extracts distro name ("Ubuntu")
  → Tries to connect to daemon (reads /tmp/wsl-git-daemon.info via UNC path)
  → If not running:
      → Deploys binary: wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -e sh -c "cp ... ~/.local/bin/ && chmod 755 ..."
      → Starts daemon: wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -e sh -c "~/.local/bin/wsl-git-daemon --daemonize"
      → Daemon forks, writes info file, parent exits, wsl.exe returns
      → Desktop reads info file, connects to daemon
  → All git/file operations go through daemon
  → If connection fails mid-session → auto-restart
```

## Staying current with upstream

This project doesn't diverge from upstream GitHub Desktop. It maintains a set of **patch files** (in `patches/`) that are applied on top of each upstream release:

1. CI checks for new upstream `release-*` tags every 6 hours
2. Clones `desktop/desktop` at the new release tag
3. Applies `patches/*.patch` via `git apply`
4. Builds the daemon + app, publishes a new release
5. If patches fail to apply → opens a GitHub Issue for manual resolution

The patches are designed to be minimal and conflict-resistant: one new file (`wsl.ts`), one new directory (`wsl-daemon/`), and small surgical changes to existing files (mostly import swaps). All patches are plain text and easy to review.

```

Most patches are one-line import changes — swapping `readFile` from `fs/promises` with `wslReadFile` from `wsl.ts`. These are unlikely to conflict with upstream changes.

- **[wsl-git-shim](https://github.com/aleixrodriala/wsl-git-shim)** — A simpler, zero-fork approach: replaces Desktop's bundled `git.exe` with a shim that routes WSL paths to `wsl.exe -e git`. Works with official Desktop but slower (~40ms overhead per command from spawning `wsl.exe`) and doesn't support file operations.
